          You may have experienced mood changes as the seasons shift and long,
          sunny days become darker and shorter, but can the same thing happen to
          your dog? We know humans can suffer from seasonal affective disorder
          (SAD). Is seasonal affective disorder in dogs something to worry
          about?
        </p>
        <p>
          To find out the answer to “Can dogs get seasonal depression,” we
          talked to two veterinarians, Sandra Faeh, DVM, president of the
          American Veterinary Medical Association, and Karen Fine, DVM in
          Central Massachusetts, for the science behind behavior changes.

          <h2>Can Dogs Get Seasonal Depression?</h2>
          <p>
            Seasonal affective disorder in dogs isn’t a known medical problem,
            at least not in the way humans experience it, according to our
            experts. That being said, your dog can experience mood fluctuations
            — particularly during times of the year when their humans schedules
            change.

            Perhaps you had a young adult home for the summer who then moved
            back to college at the start of the school year. Or, if your kids
            were home all summer or other family members spent a lot of time
            with your dog and then they returned to school or work, your dog
            might be moping around a bit. This could lead you to ask, can dogs
            get winter blues?
          </p>
          <p>
            Some dogs are very routine-oriented, from their feeding times to
            even putting themselves to bed, says Dr. Fine, author of The New
            York Times bestseller The Other Family Doctor: A Veterinarian
            Explores What Animals Can Teach Us about Love, Life, and Mortality.
            For these dogs, a disruption like a person moving out or another pet
            dying might have more of an impact than it would on another dog.

        <h2>
          Signs your dog has the winter blues or is generally feeling down may
          include:
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are some physical or behavioral signs you might notice that
          could indicate your dog isn’t feeling like themselves. Again, while
          this isn’t technically referred to as seasonal depression, it’s still
          possible for a dog to act depressed during the wintertime.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Decreased appetite</li>
          <li>Sleeping in unusual locations</li>
          <li>Loss of interest in playing or engaging with family</li>
          <li>Unexpected weight loss</li>
          <li>Self-soothing via licking or chewing</li>
          <li>Vocalizing, such as howling or whimpering</li>
          <li>
            Sad facial expressions, such as pinning ears back or droopy eyes
          </li>
          <li>Staying close to family members</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If your dog is exhibiting any of these signs, reach out to your
          veterinarian.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “One of the first things a veterinarian will ask when they do a
          checkup on your dog will be something like, ‘Have there been any
          changes in the household or routine?’” Dr. Fine says.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Consider whether your dog is getting less attention than normal, for
          instance, and if that could be playing a part in your dog’s sadness or
          boredom.
