        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="question">What vaccines do dogs actually need?<span class="icon"></span></h4>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Vaccinations are an important way of safely and effectively protecting your pet from several serious diseases. The C5 vaccination is highly recommended for all Australian dogs, as it protects against:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parvovirus</li>
                    <li>Distemper</li>
                    <li>Infectious canine hepatitis</li>
                    <li>Canine cough – including Parainfluenza virus and Bordetella bacteria</li>
                    <li>In addition we have Leptospirosis vaccinations and Rabies Vaccinations for those pets that are at risk</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            

            <h4 class="question">How often should a pet be vaccinated?<span class="icon"></span></h4>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Your pets are assessed each year with a health check and an evaluation is made to determine the frequency of vaccinations. This takes in to account risk factors of exposure, travel requirements and your pets underlying health. It is particularly important to make sure new puppies and kittens are fully vaccinated, as their immune systems are still developing.
                    Vaccinations are required:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>6 to 8 weeks of age</li>
                    <li>12 weeks of age</li>
                    <li>16 weeks of age</li>
                    <li>then Annually or Triannually for the rest of their life</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4 class="question">How many times is a dog vaccinated?<span class="icon"></span></h4>
            <p class="answer">The immune systems of new puppies take time to develop as they grow. During this growth phase, puppies require frequent visits to the vet for their early vaccinations. Once these initial vaccinations are done, our pets require an annual vaccination visit for the remainder of their lives.</p>

            <h4 class="question">What are the 5 types of vaccines for animals?<span class="icon"></span></h4>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>There are 3 vaccines commonly known as “core” vaccinations to protect your dog and 2 for cats.</p>
                <p>Dogs</p>
                <p>The C3 vaccine protects against parvovirus, distemper, and hepatitis. The C4 vaccine also protects against parainfluenza, while C5 protects against all the above as well as Bordetella bacteria.</p>
                <p>Generally, the C3 vaccine is given to your puppy at 6 to 8 weeks of age, all other future vaccinations will be C5.</p>
                <p>Cats</p>
                <p>The F3 vaccine protects your cat against both enteritis and cat flu (rhinotracheitis and calicivirus). The FIV vaccine protects your cat from feline aids virus.</p>

        <h2>Veterinary Surgery</h2>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="question">Do I need an appointment get prescription medication ?<span class="icon"></span></h4>
            <p class="answer">If it is a new occurrence then yes, we will need to examine your pet. The most important concern is your pet’s welfare therefore an examination is necessary in determining the best path and treatment for your pet.  Most drugs have legal restrictions on their supply and a consultation is be required by law before they can be dispensed. If your pet has a reoccurring problem and is seen regularly, no longer than a 6 month period between consultations, then under most circumstances we are able to rescript the appropriate medications. To save yourself time and to prevent misunderstandings please phone with your request before coming to the clinic.</p>

            <h4 class="question">How can I get my dog to take its tablet?<span class="icon"></span></h4>
            <p class="answer">Dogs are not silly, they can smell tablets and won’t just eat them out of your hand like it is a treat. Try breaking the tablets up and mixing in with their dog food. You can also try placing the broken pieces inside a piece of soft cheese, sausage even pate works. Some dogs will try and hide the pill in their mouth then spit them out, so watch them for a minute or so to make sure the pill has been swallowed. If your dog will not eat the broken tablets in any type of food, place the tablet on the very back of the dogs mouth and hold the dogs mouth shut until they swallow the tablet.</p>
        
            <h4 class="question">How do I give my dog medicine that is liquid?<span class="icon"></span></h4>
            <p class="answer">If you are on your own, it is best to try using a syringe (without the needle – your local vet can provide you with one). Hold the dogs mouth closed and insert the syringe in through the side of the mouth. If you have someone to help you, keep the mouth closed with one hand, with the nose facing upward, and with the other hand open the lower jaw. Then someone can inject into the mouth. Tickle the adams apple or block nose and your dog will swollow</p>
