          Fleas and ticks are among the most common external parasites in pets.
          Pesky mosquitoes also enjoy feasting on dogs and cats. Not only do
          fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes cause intense itchiness, but they also
          transmit diseases that can make pets seriously, and sometimes fatally,
          ill.
        </p>
        <p>
          All pets—even indoor pets—are at risk of fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes.
          These little bloodsuckers can hitch a ride inside on you or a pet and
          make themselves at home. That’s why veterinarians often recommend
          year-round parasite protection for pets, such as Simparica Trio for
          dogs or Revolution Plus for cats.

          mosquitoes pose and how to protect your pet (and yourself).

          <h2>How to Protect Your Pet from Fleas, Ticks and Mosquitoes</h2>
          <p>
            Protecting your pet from fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes is essential
            and requires a multi-pronged approach that involves treating your
            pet and the inside and outside of your home.
          </p>
          <p>
            The strategies listed below offer easy, convenient, and affordable
            ways to protect dogs, cats, and your household from pesky (and
            dangerous) parasites. Be sure to speak with your veterinarian to
            choose the most appropriate flea, tick, and mosquito protections for
            your pet and location.

        <h2>5 Dangers of Fleas, Ticks and Mosquitoes</h2>
        <h2>Flea Allergy Dermatitis</h2>
        <p>
          Dogs and cats aren’t just irritated by flea bites. They can also be
          allergic to them. A flea’s saliva has substances like enzymes and
          histamines that a pet’s immune system recognizes as foreign,
          triggering an immune reaction. This reaction leads to symptoms like
          intense scratching and biting of the skin, crusting, hair loss, hot
          spots, and secondary infections.
        </p>

        <h2>Flea-Borne Diseases</h2>
        <p>
          Fleas are notorious for transmitting diseases that can make pets ill.
          One such disease is murine typhus, caused by the bacteria
          <em>Rickettsia typhi</em>. Another disease is bartonellosis (‘cat
          scratch disease’), caused by the bacteria
          <em>Bartonella henselae</em>. Fleas also spread the plague.
        </p>

        <h2>Tapeworm Infection</h2>
        <p>
          Pets can get tapeworms by swallowing adult fleas that carry tapeworm
          larvae (immature tapeworms). These larvae then develop into adults in
          a pet’s digestive system. The segments of an adult tapeworm resemble
          grains of white rice and exit the body in a pet’s poop. Tapeworms are
          easily treated with a drug called praziquantel, which kills the
          tapeworms in the intestine.
        </p>

        <h2>Flea Infestations</h2>
        <p>
          As if flea bites aren’t bad enough, flea infestations can be even
          worse. Fleas can’t fly, but they can jump up to 2 feet, a very
          impressive feat given their tiny size. This jumping ability means
          fleas can jump from pet to pet and even from pet to human. So, if one
          of your pets has fleas, it may not be long before all of your pets and
          you begin feeling itchy from flea bites.
        </p>

        <h2>Tick-Borne Diseases</h2>
        <p>
          Ticks can carry numerous infectious diseases in their little bodies
          that affect pets, such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever,
          anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis. Generally, tick-borne
          diseases are more commonly seen in dogs than cats.
        </p>

        <h2>Tick Paralysis</h2>
        <p>
          Tick paralysis in dogs and cats is caused by toxins in a tick’s saliva
          that attack the nervous system. An affected pet’s muscles gradually
          become paralyzed, leaving them unable to walk, eat, and breathe. Ticks
          most associated with tick paralysis are the American dog tick.

          <h2>Treating your pet</h2>
          <h2>Year-Round Flea and Tick Control</h2>
          <p>
            This is the best strategy for preventing flea and tick infestations.
            All dogs and cats in your home must be on a flea and tick control
            product. These range from over-the-counter flea and tick sprays or
            collars to prescription oral and topical preventatives, such as
            Simparica chewables for dogs and Revolution topical treatments for
            dogs and cats.
          </p>

          <h2>Regular Tick Checks</h2>
          <p>
            Check your pet for ticks anytime you go outside, especially if you
            stroll through the woods, where ticks love hiding in tall grasses
            and on trees.
          </p>

          <h2>Flea Combs</h2>
          <p>
            Flea combs are an inexpensive way to remove fleas and flea eggs from
            your pet. Use a flea comb along with a flea and tick control
            product.
          </p>

          <h2>Mosquito Repellent</h2>
          <p>
            Pet-safe mosquito repellents are available to protect your pet from
            mosquitoes when outside. Ask your veterinarian for recommendations
            for pet-safe repellents.
          </p>

          <h2>Stay Indoors During Peak Hours</h2>
          <p>
            Mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk. Keeping your pet
            indoors as much as possible, especially at dawn and dusk, will help
            protect your pet from mosquitoes.
