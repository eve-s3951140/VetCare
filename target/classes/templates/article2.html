          Adopting a new cat is incredibly exciting. From picking out the
          perfect name to readying the ultimate cat-friendly casa, there’s so
          much to look forward to! However, cat adoption can often be a bit
          overwhelming, too. And that goes for first-time cat parents and
          seasoned cat moms and dads alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcoming a furry feline BFF to your home is a serious commitment. It
          requires careful consideration and plenty of preparation. Here’s a
          first-time cat owner checklist of what not to do if you’re considering
          a new kitty companion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set yourself up for success by avoiding these common cat adoption
          mistakes!

          <h2>Rushing Into Adoption</h2>
          <p>
            Caring for a cat is infinitely rewarding, but it also requires
            significant time, effort, and money. Before looking at adoptable
            cats, make sure all members of your household are on board with the
            idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Discuss the idea with the entire family,” urges Steve Dale, a
            Chicago-based certified animal behavior consultant (CABC) and
            adoption advocate. “While cats are less of a time commitment than
            dogs, they do take time, and there’s the financial commitment to
            consider, as well.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s easy to get lost in the excitement of searching for (and
            finding!) your kitty soul mate. But there are plenty of less
            exciting pet parent chores to consider, too. Like litter box
            scooping.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make sure you have a plan for how to handle such tasks before you
            seal the deal with your adorable adoptee.

        <h2>Only Looking at Kittens</h2>
        <p>
          Who doesn’t want a kitten? Famously cute, curious, and cuddly,
          itty-bitty kitties are often the most popular pets at any shelter.
          However, it’s a good idea to remain open to a cat or kitten when you
          visit the shelter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kittens can be very active and constantly crave attention. And that
          means they may not be the perfect match for everyone. If you’re not
          prepared to keep your always-on, high-energy housemate entertained,
          adopting an older cat may be the right fit for you.
        </p>
        <h2>Failing to Cat-Proof Your Home</h2>
        <p>
          Before bringing home a new cat, ensure the environment is safe for
          your curious feline friend. Here are a few cat care tips for beginners
          to keep your kitty safe.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure window screens are sturdy and secure</li>
          <li>Tie up cords for blinds and curtains</li>
          <li>Replace toxic house plants with cat-safe greenery</li>
          <li>Remove or secure choking hazards</li>
          <li>Ensure doors close fully</li>
          <li>Secure loose wires</li>
          <li>
            Keep toilets closed around kittens (if you have young children,
            toilet locks can help)
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h2>Not Creating a Safe Space</h2>
          <p>
            A new cat shouldn’t be given access to the entire house. Instead,
            provide your cat with a safe space they can use as a home base. This
            should be somewhere away from the hustle and bustle, says animal
            behavior manager Karen Reese from Operation Kindness, an animal
            shelter in north Texas.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “Cats adjusting to a new home may not do well with a lot of noise
            and traffic,” says Reese.
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            “Set up a safe area in a bedroom or bathroom. That way, the cat can
            have this space all to themselves at first.”
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This space should include necessities (food, water, and a litter
            box) as well as creature comforts (a cozy bed, a scratching post,
            and toys).
          </p>

          <p>
            Spend time bonding with your cat somewhere safe to help them settle
            into their new home. Then offer them more freedom to explore over
            the next few days.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “As your cat gets comfortable, you can offer them more space in your
            home,” says Reese. “But make sure they always have access to their
            safe area.”
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            “It can also help to ensure they have access to other hiding spaces
            around your home,” she continues. “These can be under or behind
            furniture, covered cat beds, or even boxes turned on their sides.”
